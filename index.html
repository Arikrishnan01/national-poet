                    <p class="authorSummary">The Rebel is a 30 lines poem in which the poet talks 
                        about the characteristics of a rebel in the society. 
                        A rebel is one who does everything against the norms of society. 
                        In the poem, the poet tells us that a rebel is usually hated by 
                        people but it is usually good to be one because it makes one 
                        different. A rebel is one who does everything against the norms of society.

                    <p class="authorSummary">On hearing about the death of Rabindranath Tagore on 8 August 1941,
                         a shocked Nazrul composed two poems in Tagore's memory. 
                         One of the two poems, "Rabihara" (loss of Rabi, 
                         or without Rabi), was broadcast on the All India Radio.
                         [86] Within months, Nazrul himself fell ill and gradually 
                         began losing his power of speech. His behaviour became erratic, 
                         he started spending recklessly and fell into financial difficulties.
